        <p>☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir
            Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October
            15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. <br> <br>
            ☛ He served as the 11th President of India from
            2002 to 2007. <br>  <br>
            ☛ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical
            engineering from the Madras Institute of
            Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence
            Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). <br> <br>
            ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the
            SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was
            both designed and produced in India. <br> <br>
            ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the
            program that produced a number of successful
            missiles, which helped earn him the nickname
            “Missile Man.” <br> <br>
            ☛ Among those successes was Agni, India's first
            intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
            incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was
            launched in 1989. <br>  <br>
            ☛ He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
            nuclear test by India in 1974. <br> <br>
            ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser
            to the defense minister, and he later served as
            principal scientific adviser (1999-2001) to the
            government with the rank of cabinet minister. <br> <br>
            ☛ His prominent role in the country's 1998
            nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear
            power and established Kalam as a national hero,
            although the tests caused great concern in the
            international community. <br> <br>
            ☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan
            called Technology Vision 2020, which he
            described as a road map for transforming India
            from a less-developed to a developed society in 20
            years. The plan called for, among other measures,
            increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing
            technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and
            widening access to health care and education. <br> <br>
            ☛ Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40
            universities. The Government of India honoured
            him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the
            Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with
            ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific
            advisor to the Government. <br> <br>
            ☛ In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian
            honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
            the scientific research and modernisation of
            defence technology in India. <br><br>
            ☛ In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun
            Award from the National Space Society "to
            recognize excellence in the management and
            leadership of a space-related project". <br><br>
            ☛ While delivering a lecture at the Indian
            Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam
            collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac
            arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. <br><br>
            ☛ Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in
            Odisha, was renamed Kalam Island in
            September 2015. <br><br>
            ☛ A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed
            from Aurangzeb Road to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam
            Road in August 2015. <br><br>
            ☛ In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical
            Survey of India named a newly found plant species
            as Drypetes kalamii, in his honour.
